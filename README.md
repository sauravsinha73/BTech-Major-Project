# Project Title : Development of sustainable and zero carbon emission society

A low carbon society is a society where people collaborate to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide emissions, whether emitted from the goings-on of daily life or industrial and factory processes.
In the coming years, the world will be facing challenges in economic development with the limited resources available, minimal externalities, and large
uncertainties to climate. Low-carbon society scenarios visualize social, economical, and technological transitions through which societies respond to climate change.
This project assesses the designing of structures, STP, natural lighting, and ventilation with zero carbon for transiting to a low-carbon future in India. An integrated modeling framework is used for delineating and assessing the alternative development pathways having equal cumulative CO2 emissions during the first half of the 21st century. The pathway assumes a conventional development pattern together with the use of software like AutoCAD, STAAD.Pro and design-builder to design a society in which measurement and control of energy, carbon, lighting, and comfort are ascertained. A comparative analysis of the alternative development strategies is presented on multiple indicators such as energy, natural resources, and carbon emission, and hence conclusions are drawn.
